## Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5600
VITE_WS_URL=ws://localhost:5600
VITE_APP_TITLE=ActivityWatch Dashboard
```

### API Endpoints
The dashboard expects the following API endpoints:

- `GET /api/hosts` - Get all hosts
- `GET /api/groups` - Get all host groups
- `GET /api/hosts/{id}/metrics` - Get host metrics
- `GET /api/groups/{id}/analytics` - Get group analytics
- `WebSocket /ws` - Real-time updates

## Usage

### Creating Host Groups
1. Navigate to the Groups page
2. Click "Create Group"
3. Fill in group details (name, description, color)
4. Select hosts to include in the group
5. Configure working hours and productivity categories

### Viewing Analytics
1. Select a group from the sidebar or dashboard
2. View real-time metrics and charts
3. Use time range selectors to analyze different periods
4. Export data in various formats (CSV, Excel, PDF)

### Monitoring Individual Hosts
1. Click on any host in the sidebar or group view
2. View detailed host information and real-time status
3. Analyze application usage and website activity
4. Review activity heatmaps and productivity trends

## Customization

### Adding New Chart Types
1. Create a new component in `src/components/charts/`
2. Extend the `BaseChart` component
3. Add the new chart type to the exports in `src/components/charts/index.ts`
4. Update the `ChartConfig` type in `src/types/index.ts`

### Custom Themes
Modify the theme configuration in `src/App.tsx`:

```typescript
const createAppTheme = (mode: 'light' | 'dark') => createTheme({
  palette: {
    mode,
    primary: {
      main: '#your-color',
    },
    // ... other theme options
  },
});
```

## Performance Optimization

The dashboard includes several performance optimizations:

- **Lazy Loading**: Components are loaded on demand
- **Virtual Scrolling**: For large lists of hosts and groups
- **Data Caching**: React Query for efficient data management
- **Memoization**: React.memo and useMemo for expensive calculations
- **Code Splitting**: Automatic code splitting with Vite
